		2.2 else
			2.2.1  For each trailer that is in lot do
				2.2.1.2  if it is in MasterListOfTrailers then
						update it in MasterListOfTrailers
					 		- mark as updated
			2.2.2  For each trailer in MasterListOfTrailers do	
				2.2.2.1  if it is not updated then
						throw a fit as the unit is missing!

Google SEO - important


fleetrep.net
	- Dan doesn't like the flag background
		- he like the background and photo reel at:
			dcnr.state.pa.us

Requirements
------------
	- use capital for all data
		- even customer field

	- site should be geared to:
		1. past

		- Company that owns the Unit
		- type of vehicle

	- Look into exporting the table data to excel

	- Pie Chart
		- Have 3 pieces of pi with
			- Red, 10%
			- Yellow, 50%, 75%. 90%	
			- Green, 100%
		- charts are based off of ALL their data
			- not just the data filtered from the filter input box

	- Give customers a temporary password
		- make them change it when they first log in

	
	- Email customers  once per day
		- send out all *their* rows
			- attachment or html email

			- sent out at Noon
		- administrator must check a box to allow this option
	
		- use account fleetrepairsolutions@gmail.com

	- Email customers when their unit is Complete
		- use account fleetrepairsolutions@gmail.com











	- Add new "Current Accounts" screen
		- Contains:
			- check box to enable email
			- their email
			- their customer Name





Future Possible Requirements
----------------------------
	- have a system for the employees to do a lot walk through.

	- this system will allow us to keep the units updated and determine if any trailers were missing
		- trailers missing will get a black circl and appropriate status
			- this status will not be shown to customers if the trailer is missing

	Here is the algorithm that the employees use to do the lot walkthrough:
Lot Check Algorithm:
	1.  MasterListOfTrailers = {}
		- website has no rows initially
	2.  for each day
		Mark each trailer in MasterListOfTrailers as not updated
			- website will reset the unit's update status each day to "not updated yet"
		2.1  if today is the first day then
			2.1.1  Add all trailers MasterListOfTrailers
				- the employee, while doing the walkthrough, will add each trailer into the website
		2.2 else
			2.2.1  For each trailer that is in lot do
				2.2.1.2  if it is in MasterListOfTrailers then
						update it in MasterListOfTrailers
					 		- mark as updated
							- employee will click on  the unit and click update on the update screen even if the trailer's data hasn't changed

			2.2.2  For each trailer in MasterListOfTrailers do	
				2.2.2.1  if it is not updated then
					 	- throw a fit as the unit is missing! and add to Trailer missing list
							- make row red
		2.3  Notify management that trailers in the missing trailer list  are missing
		2.4  Remove any trailers from the MasterLIstOfTrailemer that have been returned to customer
	3  Go back to Step 2 and repeat.















Hosting costs
------------------
	- the site that we need to sign up on for hosting is www.heroku.com if you would like to look at it yourself.

	$7/month for a hobby hosting account on heroku.com
		- i'm not certain of the reliability of this $7/month plan so if we get a lot of users and they start complaining of a slow connection to the fleet portal than we will need to upgrade to a more expensive plan
		- this site is where all the code resides for the website
		- we can use a hobby account and if the website becomes slow then we will need to upgrade to a ($25-$500)/month account
			- this i based on usage.  so if you use little then it will be closer to $25 and if we have tens of thousands of users then our prices will increase


	$18/month for the database
		-  this is where all the data for users and units will be stored
		-  the next plan up would be the $36/month

	$20/month to use the ssl certificate on the portal website
         	- this protects the website traffic between the user's browser and the webserver so we can encrypt emails/passwords/sites data

	$80/year for SSL Certificate
         	- this protects the website traffic between the user's browser and the webserver so we can encrypt emails/passwords/sites data
	$15/year for a domain name - ex) www.fleetrepportal.net
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So, in summary, your costs will be about, in total:  $45/month minimum and, additionally $95/year


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

New requirements 7/22/2015

It would be best to archive units 2 weeks after being marked completed. ... So yes, archive the entire row after 2 weeks from completion date.

Having the e-mail sent automatically would be best but I could have an employee do this everyday.  Thanks for looking into this.
