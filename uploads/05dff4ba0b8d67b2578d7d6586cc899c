Can we get a page right after the login that will have all the links to the other pages. Then we can have janelle produce graphics for buttons. With the disclaimer can we just put
                             !!!WARNING!!! 
              In red big letters, under that add

Building coils and other DIY activities should be left to qualified persons. Please follow this link for a better explanation of safe practices while vaping.
                      ***********LINK*********
           Be safe, quit the grit, live, laugh, vape on.
And then have the little click box to not show again and stuff
Also we need to add a new vaper link to the login. I think we will want people to add a profile with a small bio and how they got started vaping and then give them a profile picture and a vape album.
Also i was thinking about what you said about a website. I think we do need a website for people to get on and then the app for on the go. If we could launch the web site first and then move it into an app on all platforms it would allow is an idea of how big it could get and allow us to build even more hype for the app. I have not registered on go daddy yet for the sight but i will. Waiting for my new bank card to come in.

-------
This brings up another point. Security. We need to restrict this to 18 or older so when creating a login we need to ask for date of birth and set a security setting that only allows people that are 18 years or older. I guess i am also going to have to get a lawyer to write up a exemption letter for the members to sign with a social or something that says all information provided on the form is 100% true to the best of their knowledge. Or if you can find a premade form online that we just have to pay a couple bucks to use that would work too.

-------
Great idea!!! Let's do that. Most phones have access to the internet anyways so people will be able to get on that way until the app is up and running. We could use the web site to promote the app. Also we can take advantage of Facebook to promote Vapebook.

--------
I want to go with a single app. The way im looking at it is a web site and app like facebook but only for vaping. We essentially are taking facebook and cutting out all the drama and bs that comes with it and focusing on people who are quitting cigarettes by vaping and people who just vape.
